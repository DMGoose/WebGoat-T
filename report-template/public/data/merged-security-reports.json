This is particularly important for cookies, which are stored on the machine of the end-user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. If possible, avoid placing sensitive information in cookies altogether. Instead, prefer storing, in the cookie, a key that can be used to look up the sensitive information.\n\nIn general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.\n\nBe aware that external processes often store the `standard out` and `standard error` streams of the application, causing logged sensitive information to be stored as well.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code stores user credentials (in this case, their password) in a cookie in plain text:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/remember-password', function (req, res) {\n  let pw = req.param(\"current_password\");\n  // BAD: Setting a cookie value with cleartext sensitive data.\n  res.cookie(\"password\", pw);\n});\n\n```\nInstead, the credentials should be encrypted, for instance by using the Node.js `crypto` module:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar crypto = require('crypto'),\n    password = getPassword();\n\nfunction encrypt(text){\n  var cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-ctr', password);\n  return cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex');\n}\n\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/remember-password', function (req, res) {\n  let pw = req.param(\"current_password\");\n  // GOOD: Encoding the value before setting it.\n  res.cookie(\"password\", encrypt(pw));\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* M.

Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

        "remediation": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible.

        "remediation": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal.

        "remediation": "# Insecure randomness\nIf you use a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate security-sensitive values, such as passwords, attackers can more easily predict those values.\n\nPseudo-random number generators generate a sequence of numbers that only approximates the properties of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values (the seed). If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe `java.util.Random` random number generator is not cryptographically secure. Use a secure random number generator such as `java.security.SecureRandom` instead.\n\nUse a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a general rule, a value should be considered \"security-sensitive\" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following examples show different ways of generating a cookie with a random value.\n\nIn the first (BAD) case, we generate a fresh cookie by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated cookie.\n\n\n```java\nRandom r = new Random(); // BAD: Random is not cryptographically secure\n\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[16];\nr.nextBytes(bytes);\n\nString cookieValue = encode(bytes);\n\nCookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", cookieValue);\nresponse.addCookie(cookie);\n\n```\nIn the second (GOOD) case, we generate a fresh cookie by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`SecureRandom`) is cryptographically secure, so it is not possible for an attacker to predict the generated cookie.\n\n\n```java\nSecureRandom r = new SecureRandom(); // GOOD: SecureRandom is cryptographically secure\n\nbyte[] bytes = new byte[16];\nr.nextBytes(bytes);\n\nString cookieValue = encode(bytes);\n\nCookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", cookieValue);\nresponse.addCookie(cookie);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [Pseudo-random number generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).\n* Java Docs: [Random](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html).\n* Java Docs: [SecureRandom](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-330](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-338](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html).\n",

This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`.

A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY p.price\";\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);\n    q.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query3 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);\n    q.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery1.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS00-J.

Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`.

        "remediation": "# Arbitrary file access during archive extraction (\"Zip Slip\")\nExtracting files from a malicious zip file, or similar type of archive, is at risk of directory traversal attacks if filenames from the archive are not properly validated.\n\nZip archives contain archive entries representing each file in the archive. These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`). If these file paths are used to create a filesystem path, then a file operation may happen in an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nFor example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.\n\nThe recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to verify that the normalized full path of the output file starts with a prefix that matches the destination directory. Path normalization can be done with either `java.io.File.getCanonicalFile()` or `java.nio.file.Path.normalize()`. Prefix checking can be done with `String.startsWith(..)`, but it is better to use `java.nio.file.Path.startsWith(..)`, as the latter works on complete path segments.\n\nAnother alternative is to validate archive entries against a whitelist of expected files.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, a file path taken from a zip archive item entry is combined with a destination directory. The result is used as the destination file path without verifying that the result is within the destination directory. If provided with a zip file containing an archive path like `..\\sneaky-file`, then this file would be written outside the destination directory.\n\n\n```java\nvoid writeZipEntry(ZipEntry entry, File destinationDir) {\n    File file = new File(destinationDir, entry.getName());\n    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); // BAD\n    // ... write entry to fos ...\n}\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we need to verify that the normalized `file` still has `destinationDir` as its prefix, and throw an exception if this is not the case.\n\n\n```java\nvoid writeZipEntry(ZipEntry entry, File destinationDir) {\n    File file = new File(destinationDir, entry.getName());\n    if (!file.toPath().normalize().startsWith(destinationDir.toPath()))\n        throw new Exception(\"Bad zip entry\");\n    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); // OK\n    // ... write entry to fos ...\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Snyk: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability).\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n",

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nPaths that are naively constructed from data controlled by a user may be absolute paths, or may contain unexpected special characters such as \"..\". Such a path could point anywhere on the file system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nCommon validation methods include checking that the normalized path is relative and does not contain any \"..\" components, or checking that the path is contained within a safe folder.

        "remediation": "# Missing JWT signature check\nA JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. The `io.jsonwebtoken.jjwt` library is one of many libraries used for working with JWTs. It offers different methods for parsing tokens like `parse`, `parseClaimsJws`, and `parsePlaintextJws`. The last two correctly verify that the JWT is properly signed. This is done by computing the signature of the combination of header and payload and comparing the locally computed signature with the signature part of the JWT.\n\nTherefore it is necessary to provide the `JwtParser` with a key that is used for signature validation. Unfortunately the `parse` method **accepts** a JWT whose signature is empty although a signing key has been set for the parser. This means that an attacker can create arbitrary JWTs that will be accepted if this method is used.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAlways verify the signature by using either the `parseClaimsJws` and `parsePlaintextJws` methods or by overriding the `onPlaintextJws` or `onClaimsJws` of `JwtHandlerAdapter`.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows four cases where a signing key is set for a parser.

Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engine provided by Java uses a backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\nNote that Java versions 9 and above have some mitigations against ReDoS; however they aren't perfect and more complex regular expressions can still be affected by this problem.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter. Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```java\n\nif (str.length() > 1000) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```java\n\nif (str.length() > 1000) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

Read [this guide](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba).\n\n\n**Kryo** - `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` and `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5` and for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` &gt;= v5.0.0\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.esotericsoftware.kryo(5).Kryo#setRegistrationRequired` with the argument `false` on any `Kryo` instance that may deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**ObjectInputStream** - `Java Standard Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Use a validating input stream, such as `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream`.\n\n\n**SnakeYAML** - `org.yaml:snakeyaml`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: As of version 2.0.\n* **Recommendation**: For versions before 2.0, pass an instance of `org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor` to `org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml`'s constructor before using it to deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**XML Decoder** - `Standard Java Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n**ObjectMesssage** - `Java EE/Jakarta EE`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Depends on the JMS implementation.\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `readObject` directly on an `ObjectInputStream` that is constructed from untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject {\n  public int field;\n  MyObject(int field) {\n    this.field = field;\n  }\n}\n\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return (MyObject)in.readObject();

Read [this guide](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba).\n\n\n**Kryo** - `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` and `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5` and for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` &gt;= v5.0.0\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.esotericsoftware.kryo(5).Kryo#setRegistrationRequired` with the argument `false` on any `Kryo` instance that may deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**ObjectInputStream** - `Java Standard Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Use a validating input stream, such as `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream`.\n\n\n**SnakeYAML** - `org.yaml:snakeyaml`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: As of version 2.0.\n* **Recommendation**: For versions before 2.0, pass an instance of `org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor` to `org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml`'s constructor before using it to deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**XML Decoder** - `Standard Java Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n**ObjectMesssage** - `Java EE/Jakarta EE`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Depends on the JMS implementation.\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `readObject` directly on an `ObjectInputStream` that is constructed from untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject {\n  public int field;\n  MyObject(int field) {\n    this.field = field;\n  }\n}\n\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return (MyObject)in.readObject(); // BAD: in is from untrusted source\n  }\n}\n\n```\nRewriting the communication protocol to only rely on reading primitive types from the input stream removes the vulnerability.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return new MyObject(in.readInt()); // GOOD: read only an int\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [Deserialization of untrusted data](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data).\n* OWASP guidance on deserializing objects: [Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Talks by Chris Frohoff &amp;

        "full_description": "Parsing user-controlled XML documents and allowing expansion of external entity references may lead to disclosure of confidential data or denial of service.",
        "remediation": "# Resolving XML external entity in user-controlled data\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial of service, or server side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data. Denial of services can also be carried out in this situation.\n\nThere are many XML parsers for Java, and most of them are vulnerable to XXE because their default settings enable parsing of external entities. This query currently identifies vulnerable XML parsing from the following parsers: `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder`, `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader`, `org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder`/`org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder`, `javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser`,`org.dom4j.io.SAXReader`, `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource`, `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory`, `javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller` and `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe best way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable the parsing of any Document Type Declarations (DTDs) in untrusted data. If this is not possible you should disable the parsing of external general entities and external parameter entities. This improves security but the code will still be at risk of denial of service and server side request forgery attacks. Protection against denial of service attacks may also be implemented by setting entity expansion limits, which is done by default in recent JDK and JRE implementations. We recommend visiting OWASP's [XML Entity Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java), finding the specific XML parser, and applying the mitigation listed there. Other mitigations might be sufficient in some cases, but manual verification will be needed, as the query will continue to flag the parser as potentially dangerous.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `parse` on a `DocumentBuilder` that is not safely configured on untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic void parse(Socket sock) throws Exception {\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n  DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n  builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); // BAD: DTD parsing is enabled\n}\n\n```\nIn this example, the `DocumentBuilder` is created with DTD disabled, securing it against XXE attack.\n\n\n```java\npublic void disableDTDParse(Socket sock) throws Exception {\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n  factory.setFeature(\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\", true);\n  DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n  builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); // GOOD: DTD parsing is disabled\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [XML External Entity (XXE) Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).\n* OWASP guidance on parsing xml files: [XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java).\n* Paper by Timothy Morgen: [XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks](https://research.nccgroup.com/2014/05/19/xml-schema-dtd-and-entity-attacks-a-compendium-of-known-techniques/)\n* Out-of-band data retrieval: Timur Yunusov &amp; Alexey Osipov, Black hat EU 2013: [XML Out-Of-Band Data Retrieval](https://www.slideshare.net/qqlan/bh-ready-v4).\n* Denial of service attack (Billion laughs): [Billion Laughs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs)\n* The Java Tutorials: [Processing Limit Definitions.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/limits/limits.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-776](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/776.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-827](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/827.html).\n",
